# Vision: State-Driven Agent Runtime

## Vision Statement

Enable developers to build **trustworthy, adaptable AI-powered systems** by designing _the structure and constraints of agent behavior_, rather than scripting intelligence with prompts.

---

## The Core Insight

Agents fail in production not because models are weak, but because **behavior is unstructured**.

This product treats AI as a **decision engine operating inside a human-designed system**, not as the system itself.

---

## The Big Idea

Developers define:

- **States** (what kind of reasoning/action is allowed)
- **Transitions** (when behavior may change)
- **Tool eligibility** (what can touch the world)
- **Policies** (what must be approved, limited, or audited)

The agent operates _inside this structure_.

> Intelligence is constrained by design, not hope.

## Who This Is For

**Primary**

- Backend engineers
- Platform / infrastructure teams
- Internal automation teams

**Secondary**

- AI engineers embedding agents into real systems

**Not For (by design)**

- Prompt-only experimentation
- No-code users
- Consumer chatbots

---

## Product Principles (All Horizons)

1. **Structure over prompts**
2. **Safety by construction**
3. **Explainability is mandatory**
4. **Determinism where it matters**
5. **Infrastructure is optional**
6. **Humans remain accountable**

## Product Horizons

### Horizon 1 — Controlled Autonomy

Agents are:

- state-driven
- conservative
- policy-constrained
- explainable
- testable

The focus is **trustworthiness**.

---

### Horizon 2 — Operational Intelligence

Agents become:

- replayable
- simulatable
- analyzable across runs
- reusable across domains

The focus is **organizational leverage**.

---

### Horizon 3 — Governed Adaptivity

Agents may:

- propose improvements
- suggest new states or policies
- surface patterns humans didn’t encode

But:

- humans approve all evolution
- nothing self-modifies silently

The focus is **human-governed learning**.

---

## What We Will Never Be

- An “autonomous AI” platform
- A black-box decision maker
- A replacement for engineering judgment
- A prompt playground

Trust is the product.
